## Technology

Kelp is a business review app like Yelp with a React, JavaScript frontend and a RESTful, Ruby on Rails backend. The app follows the Flux architecture and renders itself with React's DOM and React Router, creating a single-page view. It also employs the Google Places and Google Maps APIs to power location-based searching and mapping of businesses.

For more information on the app, check out the [docs][documents].
